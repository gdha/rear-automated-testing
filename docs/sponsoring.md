# Request missing features (sponsoring)

The "Relax-and-Recover Automated Testing" project is funded through customers who have a valid ReaR Support contract or subscriptions.

We encourage the usage of "Relax-and-Recover Automated Testing" by every one who is interested to participate in the project and love to see comments and feedback via our [issue tracker](https://github.com/gdha/rear-automated-testing/issues).
However, we cannot promise that issues reported by the user commnunity (without ReaR subscription or support contract) will be fixed in a timely fashion. We have already invested a lot of time in this project and the main purpose was to proof to our customers base that their setup is more or less simulated and certified as working out of the box.

*Summary*: [become a ReaR customer](https://it3.be/rear-support/index.html) before requesting missing Linux distributions or tests. On the other hand, do not be shy to submit your [pull requests](https://github.com/gdha/rear-automated-testing) and ideas.
