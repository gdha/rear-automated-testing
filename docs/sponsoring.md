# Request missing features (sponsoring)

The "Relax-and-Recover Automated Testing" project can only be extended with sponsoring from customers who have a valid ReaR Support contract or subscriptions.
We cannot promise that issues reported by the user commnunity (without ReaR subscription or support contract) will be fixed in a timely fashion. We have already invested a lot of time in this project and the main purpose was to proof to our customer base that their setup is more or less simulated and certified as working out of the box.

*Summary*: [become a ReaR customer](http://it3.be/rear-support/index.html) before requesting missing feautures or tests.
