# Introduction into Relax-and-Recover Automated Testing

The purpose of this Open Source project called "Relax-and-Recover Automated Testing" is to build a system which gives the Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) developer the means to test easily changes in the ReaR code without too much manual steps.
As you know (or do not know) testing a disaster recovery process with ReaR used to be manual labour as you needed to create an ISO image, mount or boot from it, enter options, and typing `rear recover` to start the recovery itself. Complicated and too much to repeat each day.
This was the main reason to start working on this project - automate - automate the disaster recovery tests.

Albeit, a project sponsored by Customers who have a ReaR Support Contract, we wanted to share the code with all ReaR developers for free. However, new features requested by the end-users who not have a support contract will not be implemented for free. Contact IT3 Consultants, who have sponsored the ReaR project for over ten years already, for more information on sponsorship or for ReaR Support Contracts in general.
