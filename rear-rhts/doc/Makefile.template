# Example Makefile for RHTS                                          #

# It does most of the work for you, but may require further coding   #
#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~#

# The toplevel namespace within which the test lives.
# FIXME: You will need to change this:
TOPLEVEL_NAMESPACE=

# The name of the package under test:
# FIXME: you wil need to change this:
PACKAGE_NAME=

# The path of the test below the package:
# FIXME: you wil need to change this:
RELATIVE_PATH=

# Version of the Test. Used with make tag.

# The combined namespace of the test.
export TEST=/$(TOPLEVEL_NAMESPACE)/$(PACKAGE_NAME)/$(RELATIVE_PATH)


# A phony target is one that is not really the name of a file.
# It is just a name for some commands to be executed when you
# make an explicit request. There are two reasons to use a
# phony target: to avoid a conflict with a file of the same
# name, and to improve performance.

# executables to be built should be added here, they will be generated on the system under test.

# data files, .c files, scripts anything needed to either compile the test and/or run it.
