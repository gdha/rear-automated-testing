ReaR-RHTS
---------
RHTS is an obsolete package still used by beakerlib for consistency tests by RHEL for ReaR.
We have trimmed most stuff out of the package and renamed it to rear-rhts to differentiate it
from the original package.

What is not done by the package is the followingi (add all extras here below):

# ln -s /usr/share/rear-rhts /usr/share/rhts
# mkdir /mnt/scratchspace
# mkdir -m 1777 /mnt/testarea
