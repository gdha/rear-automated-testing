# Default Bareos Director configuration file for disk-only backup
#
#  For Bareos release 15.2.2 (16 November 2015) -- redhat CentOS Linux release 7.0.1406 (Core) 
#
# Each configuration item has a reference number that shows
# where this property can be changed in the configuration file.
# Search for the number to find the correct line.
#
# You have to configure the following accoring to your environment:
#
# (#01)Email Address for bareos disaster recovery.
#      Specify a mailaddress outside of your backupserver.
#      There will be one mail per day.
#
# (#02)Email Address for bareos reports. (Mail Command)
#      This mail address will recieve a report about each backup job.
#      It will be sent after the backupjob is complete.
#      Has to be configured twice ("Standard" and "Daemon" Message Ressources)
#
# (#03)Email Address for bareos operator. (Operator Command)
#      This mail address will recieve a mail immediately when the
#      bareos system needs an operator intervention.
#      May be the same address as in (#02)
#
#
# This disk-only setup stores all data into /var/lib/bareos/storage
#
# The preconfigured backup scheme is as follows:
#
#   Full Backups are done on first Saturday at 21:00              (#04)
#   Full Backups are written into the "Full" Pool                 (#05)
#   Full Backups are kept for 365 Days                            (#06)
#
#   Differential Backups are done on 2nd to 5th Saturday at 21:00 (#07)
#   Differential Backups are written into the "Differential" Pool (#08)
#   Differential Backups are kept for 90 Days                     (#09)
#
#   Incremental Backups are done monday to friday at 21:00        (#10)
#   Incremental Backups are written into the "Incremental" Pool   (#11)
#   Incremental Backups are kept for 30 Days                      (#12)
#
#   What you also have to do is to change the default fileset     (#13)
#   to either one of the demo filesets given or create our own fileset.
